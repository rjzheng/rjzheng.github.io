				<p><img src="images/Pic2.png" alt="" width="126" height="360" class="left" /></p>
				<p>Welcome to my site everyone. My name is Richard Zheng, and I am a Sophomore at UCSD studying Computer Engineering. Please feel free to learn more about me by clicking <a href = "about.html">about</a>, or browse through my <a href = "projects.html">projects</a>.</p>
				<h3>A little about myself...</h3>
				<p>I am an American born Chinese, and spent half of my life in China as a child. Growing up in Shanghai, I learned to speak, read and type Mandarin and Shanghainese fluently. I came to America as a 4th grader. Although it was hard for me to adapt to a new living style and language, I am now completely fluent with English.</p>
				<p>I have an older brother who is now a graduate student at Stanford, and received his undergraduate degree at MIT for electrical engineering. Under his influence, I gradually developed interest for Software development and coding in general. Hence, I am currently pursuing Computer Science/Engineering degree at University of California San Diego.</p>
				<p>Aside from learning in school, I like to follow tutorials online and study from other programming books during my free time. I am constantly searching for ways to improve as a programmer.In fact, I am currently learning to make iOS apps with Xcode.</p>
				<p>I hope to become successful in the field that I love, and I will devote all my effort to do so. I welcome any opportunities, so please <a href = "contact.html">contact me</a> if you are ever interested to know more about me or work with me.</p>
